The Mozilla Manifesto
Introduction
somthing.
The Internet is becoming an increasingly important part of our lives.

The Mozilla project is a global community of people who believe that openness, innovation, and opportunity are key to the continued health of the Internet.
We have worked together since 1998 to ensure that the Internet is developed in a way that benefits everyone.
We are best known for creating the Mozilla Firefox web browser.
